Git Repository Source Code: https://github.com/HarrySelwood/SoftwareAgileProject.git

Starting the Application:

1. Open the Web Application URL (shown above)
2. Register a new account if required
3. Log in with existing credentials (Admin credentials shown below in Admin Credentials section)

General User:

- The first table on the web page shown after logging in shows all equipment that has been assigned to you. 
- The form below this table allows for new equipment to be requested. The item you want to request must be entered into the first box, and the reason must be entered into the second box. Click 'Request Item' after entering details to raise the request.

Admin User:

- The first table shows all equipment in the organisation, along with all information that may be required about each asset.
- The second table shows all currently open requests from users within the organisation. Each request shows who has requested the item, what item they have requested, and the reason for the requirement. The Admin can either Accept or Reject this request using the buttons in the table.


Other Useful Instructions:

- Application Theme: the application can be toggled between light and dark mode by clicking the button in the top right of the screen labelled 'Toggle Dark Mode'.

- Logout: Under the dark mode toggle button, there is a button labelled 'Log Out', which allows the user to sign out of the account they are currently in, and either register a new account or log into a different account.
